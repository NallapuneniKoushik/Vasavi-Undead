 This is a Zombie killing game which is played in our college map. 8 members of us have formed into a team and built this entire game.
 We started from scratch and built our entire campus with minute details using MAYA. We were at level zero when we started this project.
 But with determination and hard work we completed this entire project including the logic as well as the environment
 required for it within 2 months.
